# üé• YouTube Clone (React + Redux)

A fully responsive YouTube clone built using **React**, **Redux**, **Tailwind CSS**, and modern web development practices. This project replicates core features of YouTube such as search, live chat, video playback, and a collapsible sidebar ‚Äî optimized for performance and user experience.

### ‚úÖ 2. Comment Section
- Comment section built with **dummy data** to simulate real comment threads.
- Styled using Tailwind CSS to match YouTube‚Äôs layout and hierarchy.

### ‚úÖ 3. Live Chat Functionality
- Built using **API polling** to simulate real-time chat messages.
- Messages are handled using **Redux slices**, ensuring efficient state management.
- Continuously updates the chat window to mimic a real-time experience.

### ‚úÖ 4. Optimized Search Functionality
- **Search Debouncing** to reduce API calls and improve performance.
- **Search Result Caching** using Redux to avoid duplicate requests.
- **Filtering and Highlighting** of search terms in the result list.

### ‚úÖ 5. Tech Stack Highlights

Debouncing 
  ---- Debouncing means a function will run once after event stopped firing.
  ---- If we type very fast the difference between the keystrokes is very less. And we type slow it is very high.

Debouncing is Performance Optimize

Debouncing is 200ms
 ----If it is less than 200ms don't make API Call
 ---- If it is more than 200ms call API Call.

 HOC
  ---- HOC Is a function which takes a component and returns a Component.
  ---- HOC Will take input has a component updates it and return the component.
  ---- HOC is a Pure Component which means it will not make any changes to its parent component.
